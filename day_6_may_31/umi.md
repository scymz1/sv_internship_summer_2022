### Do I want to?
No, I prefer MUI and Prime Faces, which are more widely used and due to following reasons.

### Shortcoming:
Cannot use when you:
* Require a browser support for IE 8 or lower
* Need to support React < 16.8
* Need to use a different routing scheme
* Require a lot of webpack customization
